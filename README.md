# msci_446_proj

The aim of this project is to develop a Linear Regression model with the ability to forecast the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) for a particular season. Specifically, our model will attempt to estimate the proportion of MVP votes that individual players are expected to receive based off of their statistics in a particular season

## NBA api

To create this project, we are leveraging data and player statistics from the [npa_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api)

```bash
pip install nba_api
```
